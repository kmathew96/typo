  As a blog administrator
  In order to organize the articles according to genre
  I want to be able to create and edit categories in my blog

  Background:
    Given the blog is set up
    And I am logged into the admin panel

    Given I am on the new category page
    When I fill in "category_name" with "Name-Test"
    And I press "Save"
    Then I should see "Name-Test"

    Given I am on the new category page
    When I follow "Edit"
    And I fill in "category_description" with "Edit-Test"
    Then I should see "Edit-Test"
